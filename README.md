# EECS 487 Final Project - Bias Detecton Within Mass Media

## Problem Description

In an era where the media plays a pivotal role in shaping public opinion, identifying bias has become increasingly important. For much of the public, the media is the main, if not only, source of information and influences the public’s perception of most issues or ideas. As a result, our team has focused this project on recognizing the political standings of the authors and discerning the underlying biases in articles. 
If successful, this initiative aims to promote transparency in news outlets and provide insight to the public on the influence the media has on their opinions.

Our team investigates author bias by analyzing the language elements like word choice or syntax in the input text data and then predicting the author’s ideological positions as the main output. 
This can be a vital tool for detecting bias within political spheres and discerning biased opinions within articles overall.
